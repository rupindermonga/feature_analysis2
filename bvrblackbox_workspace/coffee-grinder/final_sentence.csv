2,grinder,"I've tried super expensive grinders, butt grinders, auto grinders and I keep coming back to this one. NY Times goes on and on about the need for a burr grinder to get a consistent grind to avoid bitter coffee, but I think that's getting way too laboratory soecific. 99 percent of people won't know the difference. You'll get a consistent (enough) grind out of this if you know what you're doing and give it a little time for trial and error to get a specific grind dialed in. I use a Bialetti Italian press and this grinder helps me make fantastic and consistent coffee all day, every day."

19,product,"This product Cuisinart DCG-20BK Coffee Bar Coffee Grinder, Black DISCONTINUED BY MANUFACTURER would probably be great if all I wanted to do with it was grind spices. As a coffee grinder, it will only work if you need to grind enough for a 4-cup coffee maker. (The descriptor stating 12-cups is quite misleading.) Also, you can't overfill it with beans--if you do, it doesn't grind at all. AND, the little engine gets pretty hot, which only adds to my frustration at having not just purchased a burr.

My Cuisinart coffee maker? Now, that's five-star awesome; this little grinder, not so much. BUT, had I read the descriptor more closely, it does give little clues that it might be a little grinder..."

33,coffee,"I was a little startled to see the manual says not to grind spices in it. I decided to do so anyway, since that's what I bought it for. I can't believe how quickly and quietly it pulverizes things like flax seeds.

Update: I bought a second one of these, so now I have one for coffee and one for spices. The first one os still going strong. The only way this could be better is if it had a slightly larger, removable cup, so that you could use it for wet and dry grinding. There are some like that on the market, but they have very mixed reviews."

44,cord,"EDIT - After a few months of use I threw it away and bought a new one.

I got used to the bowl that would not remove but the cord storage was UTTERLY MADDENING! It was nigh on impossible to stuff the cord in that little, uh, pouch they provided for it. When I say I threw it away I mean I literally opened my back door and threw it as hard as I could! (I have to go pick up the pieces now)

Original post--
I don’t use these for coffee, I use them for herbs and spices. With my old one, I ran the bowl through the dishwasher, after each use, so my cinnamon did not taste like mustard. (or vice versa) ;) Not a deal breaker by any means but I miss that ability. I DO like having cord storage though!"

65,coffee bean,"Really like this bean grinder. Stick to coffee beans. The instructions say other things will dull the blades.

I looked at a lot of different coffee grinders before settling on this particular one and bought this one because of the great reviews. Wonder why Cuisinart stopped making it?

Hope it holds up as well as people report it does. Fingers crossed."

97,grinder,"I tried to use this to grind coffee. IT DOES NOT GRIND COFFEE WORTH A S&$%. But then neither does any other blade grinder I have tried. Finally got a burr grinder and will NEVER go back. However, this grinder can be made to grind spices if you are mechanically inclined. The blade on this and Cuisinart's hand held mixer is blunt and just about worthless.

However, unlike their hand held mixer, this blade can be easily removed. Just take a roughly 3/8"" dowel (a stick or handle of a wooden spoon) and place it on the right side of either blade pointed away from you. Now, whack the dowel with a wooden spoon or something. The blade will unscrew counter clockwise. Use a file or a Dremel with a stone and sharpen the blade. Now you have a fair to good grinder for spices.

One note of caution. DO NOT EVER GET ANY WATER IN THE GRINDING BOWL. The only thing separating the motor shaft from the bearing (actually a bushing) is a felt washer. Get it wet and it stays wet, corroding the shaft and speeding its demise. Also, DO NOT FILL THE GRINDING BOWL MORE THAT 3/4 OF THE WAY FULL (less for hard to grind substances). The full line is where the metal bowl ends and the plastic starts. OVERLOAD THIS CHEAP MOTOR AND IT WILL DIE."

When we finally used it here in Charleston, it ground the coffee beans OK; but we noticed that the grinder leans forward. It is lower in the front than the back because its front leg appears to be pushed in. I don't know whether that's a defect or whether it is meant to be tilted like that. I don't like it. Maybe that was why it sold so inexpensively, because it was a defective model being pushed off on an unsuspecting customer!"

Great if you like to grind your own coffee beans."

But, keep this in mind: It grinds a smaller volume at a time (for us this represents less than 10 cups of coffee that we can brew with one helping full of ground beans.

188,Amazon,"I had one of these for probably 10 years and it finally gave out. I replaced it with a Krups which costs more and, in my opinion, is an inferior product for a variety of reasons. After returning it to Amazon, I immediately replaced my broken Cuisinart with exactly the same one, only 10 years newer. This is a great coffee grinder that stands up over the long haul."

199,time,"My boyfriend has the same coffeemaker and I really liked it. The Mr. Coffee one I had worked fine but was noisier and seemed to take longer to grind the beans. Also, it is easier to remove all the grounds from the Cuisinart than from the Mr. Coffee grinders. My cat always ran upstairs when I used the Mr. Coffee grinder. Now he still runs but not as far and the Cuisinart grinds in less time so he can return sooner."

229,product,Product works as expected but if you like to make 10 or more cups of coffee at once you will find the grinding chamber too small on this unit. I also don't like the lid which has a plastic inner ring that the coffee beans like to get stuck in. These beans make it tough to close the top so you can engage the start switch and won't get ground up if you do manage to start it. It is also difficult to dump the ground product into the coffee maker as the lid won't hold all the coffee so you have to unplug the unit and tip the whole machine over to empty it. On the plus side unit has plenty of power and has a reasonable quality feel to it.

246,time,"This grinder has a nice aesthetic design and powerful motor/blade. Only takes a few seconds to make very finely ground coffee. Only drawback is the coffee bean capacity. If you want to make more than a couple cups of coffee at a time, you need to grind multiple batches of beans."
254,review,"This is the second Cuisinart I own. The motor burned on the first one. I bought the same one as to preserve the Lid from the first one as a Spare. I had the Braun counterpart before and the lid broke on me. The only real complain I have about this unit is the fact that the lid is very dark and you can't see well inside to evaluate the grinding process.

I liked the Braun better as the lid is clear and you can see what's happening inside; this way you can achieve the proper grind without opening the lid to check.

The Braun has 150 Watt motor while the Cuisinart has 130 W. The Cuisinart looks more modern and sharper. With either you can get a good grind, but I would go with the Braun.....I'm currently considering a Burr grinder, but I can't sell my self that it'll be worth all that counter realstate....I keep my coffee in the fridge, and after grinding it to fine it does not feel hot, maybe warm if I grind to a super fine. From the reviews I read on the Burr Grinders, it looks like a lot more hassle, but what the heck, we love to complicate our lives...."

I already bought one for my mom and I am going to purchase more."

There are measuring ""dots"" on the side of the lid that can be used to measure the amount of beans you're adding to the grinder, but with irregular shaped beans, you never know if the measure is to the top or middle of the bean level. Cord storage is an issue, especially before you've had your first cup of coffee in the morning..."

373,way,"I recently purchased a Cuisinart Cuisinart DCG-20N Coffee Bar Coffee Grinder, White. I bought it because my Cuisinart Grind and Brew coffee maker did not grind the coffee fine enough for my taste and there is no way to adjust it.

The DCG-20N coffee grinder is probably the poorest designed coffee grinder I have ever seen. The lid for the grinder fits INSIDE the bowl of the grinder. It is almost impossible to get the lid on once the bowl is filled with coffee beans. You can force the lid on, but then there are coffee beans that are trapped outside the lid between the lid and the casing. Then when you go to pour the ground coffee out, you get some beans that did not get ground at all. Why in the name of all that is sane did you have the lid go INSIDE the casing???

If I had not already thrown away the box it came in, I would CERTAINLY have returned it!

I bought a Cuisinart grinder expecting a quality product. I certainly did NOT get one with this coffee grinder!"

404,motor,"Motor quit the second day! I am not kidding. And as others said, it really wasn't big enough. If you got your 12 cups worth you had to remove the lid over another container because the grounds will spill out. Finally, it is poorly designed with an extra wall in the lid - the only function of which is to capture grounds and beans so you can have trouble cleaning it.

I'm a fool. After buying their combo grinder/maker for our new second home, I gave up cleaning that joke every day and got the seperate maker and grinder of the same brand.

I'm a fool, don't be like me. Buy performance, not looks. Back to Krups."

I'm a big Cuisinart fan and this looks great next to all my other Cusinart appliances so I recommend it.

The grinder bowl only holds about 8 scoops max of beans (8-10 cups of coffee), and when full, the blade struggles to work through the beans, leaving some unground near the top."

484,problem,"I've used and owned a few coffee grinders over the years and I was given this one as a gift from my gf.How can I politely say horrible gift without being ""shut out"".Firstly and foremost of it's problems is it is not high capacity.It does not grind for 12 cups unless you prefer really weak coffee.The capacity is very small,maybe 7 cups and transporting the ground coffee and inserting it into your coffee filter takes dexterity and magic as when you lift the top to pour,coffee grinds spill all over your countertop,wasting most if not all of your precious ground coffee.Also,if the top is not securely placed,it will not grind and if you put too many beans,they will just spin around without being ground....which leads to the first problem of sweeping up your unground coffee.Funny that I purchased a $10 no-name grinder with a large capacity cup 12 years ago that never let me down.Ah,those were the days of quality and endurance.Anyway I shelved the cuisinart and bought the Mr.Coffee( -IDS55-4-Grinder-White) instead.....love it!"

509,Amazon,"I cannot state strongly enough how quickly you should run from this piece of junk. I've owned coffee grinders for decades - mine is a German brand (update: just checked, mine is a Siemens, and I don't find them anymore on Amazon, which is too bad) - and we just got this model at my mom's house. It simply doesn't work. Isn't strong enough. Doesn't hold enough coffee. The blade isn't sharp enough. And then it started smoking from the ""overwork.""

1. This holds far fewer coffee beans than my German model. Which is a problem when you're using a cafetiere that requires a decent amount of ground coffee. Again, compared to my other model, this holds far less coffee.

2. Either the blade isn't sharp enough, or fast enough, or the motor isn't strong enoug, but it simply wouldn't chop up the beans fully. I was going to attach a photo of what it did to my Jamaica Blue Mountain beans after about a minute of grinding (which entailed the machine constantly stopping and me constantly sticking my finger in there to unjam the blade), but I seem to have lost that option in these reviews. Suffice it to say I had chunks of coffee grounds throughout - this stuff didn't even look like Folgers, let alone halfway to espresso, which is how I like my coffee. There were huge chunks of beans in there, a lot of them. It's not that the device doesn't work well, it doesn't work - period.

3. It start smoking after a few minutes of unjamming the thing and trying to continue grinding the beans.

I have owned similar devices for decades. This thing is a piece of junk. It even feels like a piece of junk - very lightweight, in a bad way. At it most basic level, grinding coffee, this thing failed. It simply didn't grind the coffee at all. I'm really disappointed that Cuisinart would put its name on something like this. (I tried to find out where it's made, but it wasn't entirely clear from the box.)

You can check my other reviews, I don't pan everything. This, however, is a piece of garbage. Run, don't walk, to another brand as fast as you can. It's not worth twenty bucks. It's not worth two bucks. It simply doesn't work.

UPDATE: It's dead. Mom just tried using it, and the thing is dead. Mind you, we used this thing once, followed the instructions about not putting in too much coffee (mind you, my german brand has no such rules), and it smoked and went to coffee grinder heaven."

565,product,"I had the Krupps grinder for literally fifteen years before the bottom came undone. I didn't feel like taping it for an item that only cost me $10 to begin with. I bought the Cuisinart because the Krupps is black, and I wanted a white grinder to match my kitchen. I do like the design of this product for some odd reason, it's a shape that it's a little more appealing to the eye than the Krupps. Yet I would soon discover how little that matters, and more to the point, how utterly inferior this product is. When I tried filling the already small cabin with beans, it wouldn't properly grind. I was forced to do it one half at a time. Then, this morning, only a week after arrival, it stopped working entirely. An odd smell emanated from it. I concluded that it was the motor slightly burning. I took out the beans, and lodged on each side of the inner cabin, between the blade and sides, was a half ground bean, preventing the blade from propelling. Not once in fifteen years did this happen with my Krupps. The motor is weak, or the blades are not sharp, or some combination thereof, and I have neither the time nor the caffeine-less inclination to investigate further. I am returning it, and getting a brand new Black Krupps that doesn't go in my kitchen. It's color to perfectly match my heart's sentiments about this deeply disappointing product."

587,year,"While this coffee grinder technically works, it has a number of serious flaws. I have used a number of coffee grinders over the years, and I don't like this one at all. The resevoir is too small to make a pot of coffee so you have to grind two batches for a full pot. It is also way too time-consuming to get the grind fine enough even for a decent pot of drip coffee.

If you like it weak and make a very small pot, like 2-4 cups, this will work. Most people who use a coffee grinder for any reason will want something better."

I had been borrowing a friends ProtorSilex and for a blade grinder it let me make a decent cup of coffee. (It's hard not to get a good cup here in the western highlands of Guatemala .. eat your hearts out :-) Any way this things lid just sucks. I'm only grinding about 3/8 of a cup of beans at a time (for a 16oz cup.. if anyone has a recommendation for the amounts of beans to use per 8oz of water I'd appreciate it) The advert says grinds enough for 12 cups.. No freaking way unless you're serving in Demitasse cups.
As far as the lid, I have yet been able to pour my grounds into a 600ml french press without getting grounds on the counter. The ProcterSilex was no problem. The Cuisenart has some kind of chamber around the main chamber for the grounds and grinds get in there and then spill out. The PS I borrowed poured clean.
Also this thing has about 3 times the residue on it compared to the PS machine. That may be because it is grinding finer than the PS. I'm going to work on pulsing the machine to make a courser grind and this observation may change. The Cuisenart also advertised that it had storage for the cord. There some hollow space in the body of the machine which I can carefully slip about half the chord into but if this is what they meant, dream on.

Also this thing has about 3 times the residue on it compared to the PS machine. That may be because it is grinding finer than the PS. I'm going to work on pulsing the machine to make a courser grind and this observation may change. The Cuisenart also advertised that it had storage for the cord.

647,cord,"I purchased this grinder to replace my 20+year old Braun whose cord had come apart (it still works). The smaller Braun can easily grind a 12 cup pot, fast and effectively. This machine on the other hand is quite a bit larger and when I attempted to grind enough beans for a strong 10 cup pot, the blade quit spinning several times and after enough fooling around it chopped them up, but one could hardly call it a ground bean, it looked more like grass clippings.

I doubt this thing will last very long after watching it literally stop working with a full load of beans to grind. I now use it for a small afternoon pot of coffee, half full of beans it will eventually produce a ""ground"" bean product. Another annoyance is its shape, difficult to hold on to especially early in the morning if you happen to have a touch of arthritis.

NOT worth even the $13 it is advertised for on here.

UPDATE: If I could give it less than one star, I would. After putting up with this grinder for a brief period, I moved it to my RV to take on trips a couple of times a year, and moved my now 24 year old Krups grinder back to first string. This terrible product worked on the first trip, in its own feeble way, chopping up, shredding beans enough to make a couple of cups of strong coffee. Now, six months later, the beans jam the blades each time you attempt to fill it beyond the height of the shallow metal cup. I'm ordering another Krups this week before they change the style of that machine. Don't waste your cash on the Cuisinart."

694,unit,"The mother of a good friend of mine included this grinder in a gift basket she gave me at my bridal shower. I don't really drink coffee and my husband isn't the type to grind his own beans, but I quickly found a good use for this little gadget in the form of grinding fresh spices and nuts, as well as making confectioner's sugar (""why would you make your own powdered sugar?"" you ask. Because I don't eat refined sugar and, as far as I know, you can't buy raw/unrefined confectioner's sugar - but if anyone knows where you can, please tell me!). You can only grind about 1/2 a cup at a time, but that hasn't really been a big issue to me, although I can see where it would be if you're trying to grind coffee for several people in a timely manner.

Now, I wouldn't try fully immersing the unit in water or anything like that, but rinsing the inside out isn't going to short the motor. It isn't terribly noisy, but it's not whisper quiet either...I mean, you're grinding solid objects into powder, some noise is to be expected.

727,price,"I had this coffee grinder for about 5 years before dropping it on the ground from about 6 feet up and breaking the lid. I looked around on amazon and ended up buying a Krups coffee grinder to replace it. After using the Krups for about 2 weeks, I miss my Cuisinart! A true (if somewhat trivial) case of not knowing what I had until it was gone. I may try to superglue my old one back together, or I may just break down and buy a new one of these, because I think it's clearly superior to the Krups.

This grinder doesn't grind as fast as the Krups, and it's probably a little bit louder, but the consistency of the grind is FAR superior to the Krups grinder, and that's really all that matters to me! I could grind for a short period of time to get perfect percolator coffee grounds for camping coffee, a little longer to get a good consistent grind for drip coffee, or a little longer yet to get a pretty good grind for espresso. The Krups I got to replace it will leave some beans in large chunks and some espresso-powder fine. The only time I can get grounds with even consistency is if I go for a long enough time to get them all at espresso level.

It's fairly small, and I would fill it a little more than what the directions said to do, but I could get grounds enough for a strong 12 cup pot of coffee, and there would be no large chunks that came to the surface of the grounds when I went to remove the filter. And like I said earlier - it lasted me 5 years and would have gone longer had I not been clumsy. Solid coffee grinder for the price - I highly recommend it."

743,french press,"This is a basic coffee grinder for the non-enthusiast. It grinds the coffee; but like others in this class, the beans are not ground consistently. You end up with some fine ground and some course ground in the same batch. One cause for this is that the grinding cup is proportionally too deep as compared to the blade. So the beans don't circulate adequately to even-out the grind.

Secondly, the claim of being large enough for 12 cups is simply false. I can only grind enough beans for 2 cups. Of course I use a French press, so I use more beans. But seriously, this only holds 5 scoops of beans. If you're making 12 cups of coffee with 5 scoops, that's some mighty watery coffee. Or maybe you're making demitasse cups. But even with 2-3 oz. cups, I don't think this has the capacity for 12. And let's face it, if we're buying a coffee grinder we probably like coffee and drink the standard size cup.

Regarding the design, it's not round, but rather has a bulge on the right side which makes it awkward to hold. It's almost like it was designed for left handed people.

I'm not a hater. It's functional, and I use it. But it has drawbacks that will make me look for a higher quality grinder next time through."
760,french press,"I just purchased another DCG-20N after I accidentally broke the plastic cover this morning on mine. I read all of the 1 star reviews just out of curiosity, of which there were many, as I've had mine at least 2 years and have had no problems with it. I brew with a french press and this grinder grinds enough for 2 large, strong cups of Peete's whole bean coffee. It grinds very evenly and even down to a powder form after about 15 seconds. I guess every product out there has some ""lemons"" so maybe I just got lucky. However, go with what works, which is why I ordered another one as it works great."

788,spice,"Nice little inexpensive coffee mill. It allows you to grind coffee all the way down to a powder if you want to. It grinds fairly evenly, but not as well as a good burr mill. It cleans out easily and also works great for grinding other herbs and spices, and making for making meat rubs. It's fairly loud, so use it after everybody is awake (or as a morning wake up call). It is probably the best buy for under $20. If you have never ground your own coffee, this is a great way to get a good cup of coffee for little cost. It also takes up very little counter space and it's available in colors to match just about any kitchen."
807,use,"I just bought this thing today and used it. Less than two minutes. It lasted less than two minutes of being in use before none of the coffee was ground and smoke was pouring out of the motor. Do NOT buy this piece of crap. One star is too kind.

EDIT:
Tried another of this same one, thinking the last one was defective. IT WAS NOT. The same thing happened, but spanned over only a couple of uses. There is a MAJOR DESIGN FLAW which causes coffee beans to become lodged between the blade and the body of the grinder and it just catches itself on fire. Really, Cuisinart? Biggest waste of time and money."
821,cup,"I received this product through Cuisinart's rebate after purchasing their coffeemaker DCC 2650 at Bloomingdale's. The coffeemaker was mediocre and I actually purchased an Aerobie aeropress in the end. But going back to the grinder, I'm glad that I spent zero dollars on the product and it worked okay during the first 10 grinds. The cup is very small and I had a large can of beans to grind.

Afterwards, it was dead. Didn't even sputter and die, just went dead after using the grinder as directed. I suggest you spend the money on something else rather than this product. I've never had any bad experiences with Cuisinart before and is disappointed that this grinder would go so quickly. I'll just stick to grinding my beans at the local supermarket before bringing it home."
851,cord,"This product is pretty lame -- many design defaults. Although I like other Cuisinart products I would stay away from this one. It does a fine job of actually grinding the beans but there are too many drawbacks to keep it: the cord storage is a joke (it does not wind interally, you have to shove the cord into the space on the side, and the entire cord doesn't fit completely), the cord itself is short, because of the lid design grounds or beans get caught in, it making it hard to clean, and it is much larger than the Krups grinder I've had for 10+ years. There are much better products available. Even though it's not broken I am going to return it immediatley."
891,button,"Ok grinder. Sometimes the button to turn it on just won't work. No real reason. I have to try multiple times before it starts... cable is so short that I can't stand it on the table and plug it it, thus have to STAND next to the electrical outlet while grinding (standing) with the grinder in my hand.
It does the job but meh quality."

We are madly loyal to Cuisinart brand; this is the first bad product of the many we have purchased from them. Makes us wonder if this isn't some cheap knock-off rebadged?

Any way; back to Sears with this one."

999,water,"I received this grinder as a Christmas gift from my son-in-law after my cheapo, cheapo grinder went kaput! I am surprised at some of the not so happy reviews because we use this grinder every single day, sometimes twice in one day, and it works really well.

If the grinder is dedicated for coffee or spices, there's no need to clean it (like, with water and soap; just tap around the outside canister and all the excess residue falls off the edges into the cup/blade area.

I really like the grinder, and knowing my luck, this Cuisinart will last a long time only because I've had my eye on a Kitchen Aid coffee grinder (to match the rest of my appliances) and just happened to get this one as a gift. Oh well! But, the grinder is worth the money, and it does what it's supposed to do. Unless you're the type of person who needs directions on how to breathe, this grinder is a no-brainer :-)"
1037,counter,"This grinder has a small capacity [not as advertised]. If you follow directions, it will only grind enough for 4 cups at a time. Also, for some reason it generates a static charge and there is coffee dust all over the counter after emptying it. The cord is stiff and the cord storage is inconvienient. Finally, it is much more noisy than my old one."
1039,ground coffee,"After using a previous one of these and wearing it out, the Krups competing grinder was tried out. Krups works very well and grinds even finer than this one, but leaves a small amount of coffee near the blades. So, this Cuisinart grinder was ordered to replace the first one. It works great, comes in black or white, and all the ground coffee can be tapped out easily."
1064,Amazon,This one works great. Already ground some beans. I was so excited when I found on Amazon. I needed to replace the one I have had for 20 years almost. Think same series. Very little has changed old smoked plastic on lid where this on is clear. Otherwise same. The safety tab had worn down on old one. So been a trick. This morning I had it. Already have 7:24 pm! Yeah Amazon!
1084,counter,"This is my second coffee grinder by Cuisinart. I have a previous one that fell from the counter and cracked the lid. That model has lasted for at least three years without any problem. Since I am satisfied with this model I bought another replacement.

The space for the coffee beans is limited. If you are going to make a full pot of coffee you will have to grind 2 or 3 loads. For the 6 cups of coffee I brew in the morning I only need to grind two full loads of coffee beans. If you don't overload the coffee beans it works fine. I recommend finding measuring cup. Once you grind the beans it is good to shake the grinder to get all of the beans ground. If you do this you get perfectly ground coffee.

The cord of the grinder is about 18"". It's a little shorter than their previous model but manageable. Compared to a Mr. Coffee grinders whose motors kept burning out I would definitely recommend this model."
1108,Amazon,I use this as a pepper grinder. My first one lasted many years. When it died I went straight to Amazon and ordered another. I keep my ground pepper in a tiny bowl on my stove so it is easy to add a pinch and see exactly how much you are using.
1143,price,"This grinder is relatively quiet and compact. I also like the integrated cable storage (which I didn't even notice at first!); however the grinding isn't very consistent, and I haven't been able to get a consistent fine grind not matter how long I grind it for. The grounds at the top are fine but at the bottom are coarse. Overall, it's what I had expected, and it's good enough, especially for the price"
1161,unit,"I'm very happy with this small grinder. It works great and wipes clean easily. To store, I just wrap the cord around the unit and tuck the plug under one round of cord. It takes up very little shelf space. I don't bring coffee every day... I grind a full bowl each four or five days and keep the extra in the freezer for use on subsequent days."
1172,unit,Like a piece of art grinding away on my counter. Works well and simple...no unnecessary buttons and dials. Its design flaw is the same as most of them and would be hard to reasonably fix...You must flip the whole unit over to dump coffee into the cap. Would have to be bigger and a ton more pricey to fix.
1191,button,I bought this to grind coffee for espresso. I was worried that it wouldn't get the beans fine enough or they would be inconsistently ground. Nope. I hold the button down and gently shake the grinder just to move everything around and in 30 seconds I have perfectly ground espresso. Super-fine and even. Love this machine.
1211,button,I used this machine for the first time today. 2 or 3 presses on the button and the coffee beans were ground to little coarse grounds. Not too fine and not too coarse. Just perfect. I don't understand why so many people complain about the noise. What do you expect? It's quieter than a vacuum cleaner. Or a garbage disposal. Do you complain about those too? I highly recommend it. There's no need to pay more than 20 bucks.
1228,french press,"This is a lovely, heavy unit that works beautifully. I bought it mainly for spices but did use it first for coffee beans when I was having trouble with my burr grinder. Since I'm used to turning a wheel on the burr grinder to get the level of grind I need, I had to experiment a couple of times to get it right with this grinder but the result was consistent and evenly ground coffee beans. I used them in my french press and it was perfect.

I'll probably keep this exclusively for spices since I already have a burr grinder but it is a well made, attractive addition to my countertop and I found nothing awkward about using it. The top fits well and the pulsing was far more quiet than I'd expected. A good product in all I'd say."

1248,review,"So I never write reviews but this product is so frustrating I had to. I figured with a Cuisinart coffee grinder I couldn't go wrong, but this thing sucks. The way the lid fits on the top means you can't load that many beans, and have to move the beans out of the way for it to fully close. It's such a small amount I have to do it twice to make a small batch of French press coffee. I've used other grinders that work perfectly so I never even imagined that a design could be so flawed, especially for Cuisinart. Disappointing. Cheaper ones I've bought by ""no name"" brands are far better."
1263,burr grinder,"I've tried super expensive grinders, butt grinders, auto grinders and I keep coming back to this one. NY Times goes on and on about the need for a burr grinder to get a consistent grind to avoid bitter coffee, but I think that's getting way too laboratory soecific. 99 percent of people won't know the difference. You'll get a consistent (enough) grind out of this if you know what you're doing and give it a little time for trial and error to get a specific grind dialed in. I use a Bialetti Italian press and this grinder helps me make fantastic and consistent coffee all day, every day."
1344,water,"I tried to use this to grind coffee. IT DOES NOT GRIND COFFEE WORTH A S&$%. But then neither does any other blade grinder I have tried. Finally got a burr grinder and will NEVER go back. However, this grinder can be made to grind spices if you are mechanically inclined. The blade on this and Cuisinart's hand held mixer is blunt and just about worthless.

However, unlike their hand held mixer, this blade can be easily removed. Just take a roughly 3/8"" dowel (a stick or handle of a wooden spoon) and place it on the right side of either blade pointed away from you. Now, whack the dowel with a wooden spoon or something. The blade will unscrew counter clockwise. Use a file or a Dremel with a stone and sharpen the blade. Now you have a fair to good grinder for spices.

One note of caution. DO NOT EVER GET ANY WATER IN THE GRINDING BOWL. The only thing separating the motor shaft from the bearing (actually a bushing) is a felt washer. Get it wet and it stays wet, corroding the shaft and speeding its demise. Also, DO NOT FILL THE GRINDING BOWL MORE THAT 3/4 OF THE WAY FULL (less for hard to grind substances). The full line is where the metal bowl ends and the plastic starts. OVERLOAD THIS CHEAP MOTOR AND IT WILL DIE."

I recently stayed at a Airbnb and they had this coffee grinder, I used it and instantly fell in love. With a few quick presses of the triangular button it grinds the coffee beans into coarse pieces perfect for a French press, plus the amount of coffee it grinds is perfect AND no clean up! I dump the grinds straight into my French press for the perfect morning coffee. The price is unbeatable."

After returning it to Amazon, I immediately replaced my broken Cuisinart with exactly the same one, only 10 years newer. This is a great coffee grinder that stands up over the long haul."
1429,review,"This is the second Cuisinart I own. The motor burned on the first one. I bought the same one as to preserve the Lid from the first one as a Spare. I had the Braun counterpart before and the lid broke on me. The only real complain I have about this unit is the fact that the lid is very dark and you can't see well inside to evaluate the grinding process.

I liked the Braun better as the lid is clear and you can see what's happening inside; this way you can achieve the proper grind without opening the lid to check.

The Braun has 150 Watt motor while the Cuisinart has 130 W. The Cuisinart looks more modern and sharper. With either you can get a good grind, but I would go with the Braun.....I'm currently considering a Burr grinder, but I can't sell my self that it'll be worth all that counter realstate....I keep my coffee in the fridge, and after grinding it to fine it does not feel hot, maybe warm if I grind to a super fine. From the reviews I read on the Burr Grinders, it looks like a lot more hassle, but what the heck, we love to complicate our lives...."
